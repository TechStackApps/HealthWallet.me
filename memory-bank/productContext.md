# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

This section describes the problem space, user needs, and the overall product experience goals for the Health Wallet application.

### Problem Space

-   Patients often have fragmented medical records scattered across different healthcare providers, making it difficult to get a holistic view of their health.
-   Accessing personal health information can be a cumbersome and manual process.
-   Lack of a centralized platform for managing appointments, medications, and health data leads to inefficiencies and potential errors.

### How It Should Work

-   **Onboarding:** Users should be able to create an account and securely log in.
-   **Dashboard:** A central dashboard will provide a summary of the user's health information, upcoming appointments, and recent activity.
-   **Health Records:** Users can view detailed information for various categories (e.g., allergies, medications, lab results).
-   **Data Sync:** The app will allow users to connect to their healthcare providers and sync their medical records automatically.
-   **Profile Management:** Users can manage their profile information and app preferences.

### User Experience Goals

-   **Clarity:** The app should present complex medical information in a clear and understandable way.
-   **Accessibility:** Ensure the app is usable for people with disabilities.
-   **Trust:** Build user trust through transparent data handling practices and a secure environment.
