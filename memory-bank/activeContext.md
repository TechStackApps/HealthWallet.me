# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

This document tracks the current focus of development, recent changes, and next steps. It is the most frequently updated file in the memory bank.

### Current Task

-   **Records Feature:** Reorganized the file structure for `allergies` and `medications` data types.

### Recent Changes

-   Created subdirectories for `allergy` and `medication` within the `records` feature's `data/dto` and `domain/entity` folders.
-   Moved the corresponding files into the new subdirectories.
-   Updated import paths to reflect the new file locations.
-   Updated the `memory-bank` documentation to reflect the new, more granular structure.

### Next Steps

1.  Verify the implementation of the records filtering.
2.  Address the error in `test/widget_test.dart`.
3.  Begin implementation of the authentication feature.

### Active Decisions & Considerations

-   The initial focus is on establishing a solid foundation for the project through clear documentation and a well-defined structure.
-   The error in the widget test needs to be resolved before proceeding with feature development to ensure a stable testing environment.
