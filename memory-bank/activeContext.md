# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

This document tracks the current focus of development, recent changes, and next steps. It is the most frequently updated file in the memory bank.

### Current Task

-   **Refactor Authentication Flow:** Refactored the authentication flow to be an optional step in the onboarding process.

### Recent Changes

-   Created a new `AuthPage` at `lib/features/onboarding/presentation/pages/auth_page.dart` to handle the authentication setup.
-   Added the `AuthPage` as the fourth step in the `OnboardingPage`.
-   Added a biometric authentication toggle to the `ProfileContent` widget.
-   Updated the `UserProfileBloc` to handle the new biometric authentication state.
-   Removed the `AuthGate` widget and updated the `main.dart` file to use the `App` widget directly.
-   Updated the `SplashPage` to navigate to the `AuthPage` if biometric authentication is enabled.
-   **Manual Step:** The old `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example` directory needs to be deleted.

### Next Steps

1.  Implement the `Source` table and related logic.
2.  Verify the implementation of the records filtering.
3.  Address the error in `test/widget_test.dart`.

### Active Decisions & Considerations

-   The initial focus is on establishing a solid foundation for the project through clear documentation and a well-defined structure.
-   The error in the widget test needs to be resolved before proceeding with feature development to ensure a stable testing environment.
